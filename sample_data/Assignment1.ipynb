       "  'notes': 'Built for comfort as much as speed, the 2008 vintage is packed with fruit and ready to roll, reminding us of our outstanding 2002 Reserve Cabernet. Like the rich interior of a Ferrari GTB, the nose is showy, ripe and rustic with black currant, clove, tar and exotic oak spices. Under the hood this blend of 98% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot shows plenty of extract and fleshy fruit delivering seamless power and expansive mouth feel. Moderate, chocolaty tannins engage mid-palate to gradually tighten the chassis and bring a lively quality to the ride.'},\n",

       "  'notes': \"This elegant and opulently spiced 2009 Reserve Cabernet is sourced from a small collection of hillside and benchland vineyards rooted in the Oak Knoll and Calistoga appellations. Infused with exotic oak, cocoa and clove spices this blend of 98% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot is powerfully aromatic. Sweet black currant and boysenberry flavors gradually take the backseat to a more muscular mid-palate framed with sinewy tannins and baker's chocolate.\"},\n",

       "  'notes': 'The best qualities from our past two vintages come together like yin and yang in our singular 2014 Reserve Cabernet.  Radiant color and soaring aromas of ripe blackberry, toasty oak spices, black truffle and cappuccino make an impressive entrÃ©e.  Fleshy and supple at first, the wine expands into deeper, more concentrated fruit layers with chocolaty, fine-grained tannins.'},\n",

       "  'notes': 'The headline reads: \"2012 Reserve Cabernet - Return of the Big Block\". Running on high octane aromas and built on an iron block with deep reserves of black fruit this 100% Cabernet blend delivers 700 horsepower at the wheels. Coming off idle the nose slowly explodes with sappy dark and rustic berries, clove, cedar and sweet oak spices. Forged, ripe fruit pistons pump out the power for miles until finally finishing with an impressive band of ported and polished tannins. Motor must be warmed-up before driving!'},\n",

       "  'notes': 'Positioned between brothers, Alec and Mason, Ethan gets a walk-off home run in his first at-bat since the 2005 vintage. At short-stop Ethan sees lots of action and his wine covers all the bases with black raspberry, yellow peach and pancetta, plus a field of lavender, licorice and violets. Like a seasoned glove the wine has a supple pocket of boysenberry fruit generously laced with sweet oak and vanilla spice. He keeps his eye on the ball and the wine stays focused though a vibrant, youthful finish, making the out on every play.'}}"
