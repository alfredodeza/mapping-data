625,Leonetti Sangiovese 2006,,"Walla Walla Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92.0,"The opening nose of this wine is textbook Sangiovese. Strawberries and strawberry preserves dominate the fruit profile backed up by some beautiful floral notes and aromatics you would expect of an old-world Brunello or Chianti such as saddle leather and earth. The palate reveals the wine's youth as it is a big, tannic youngster on the first taste. This gives way to impressive length, some chalky oak, with a fantastic cutting acidity, focus and a burst of fruit that makes this wine's profile just explode wtih food. We're very proud to have this wine in the Leonetti stable, as it is so entirely different from our Bordeaux variety wines and yet so entirely attractive in those differences. We are also tremendously happy with our decision to add an extra 6 months of bottle age, further improving our Sangiovese program, already critically noted as the finest in the U.S., if not the world!

629,Leonetti Sangiovese 2011,,"Walla Walla Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,90.0,"Beautiful ruby color.

630,Leonetti Sangiovese 2010,,"Walla Walla Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92.0,"Very dark color that any Brunello from the finest of vintages would envy. The nose bursts with bright, freshly macerated ripe strawberries and Bing cherries. There is a sense of stoney minerality that you'll positively love. On the palate, reserved sweet fruit. Ripe and plentiful ""Brunello"" style tannin. Possessing beautiful precision and focus, this Sangiovese epitomizes leanness and power. A paradox in a glass! Being a ""dream vintage"", the 2010 Sangiovese may be Leonetti's finest to date and will age for decades if you can keep your hands off it. "
631,Leonetti Sangiovese 2013,,"Walla Walla Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,91.0,"The 2013 Leonetti Sangiovese is loaded with cranberry, black cherry, pomegranate, and notes of white tea. The palate is so incredibly refreshing and will compliment almost any food."
632,Leonetti Sangiovese 2012,,"Walla Walla Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92.0,"Beautiful deep garnet color. The nose displays driving, darkred Bing cherries. This wine tastes like a liquid expression of that flavor. A unique contributing factor to this wine blend is theaddition of 8% of the varietal Aglianico. A first for WallaWalla Valley, we planted this ancient grape of southernItaly in our Serra Pedace Vineyard. We tried a splash of thisvarietal in the blend and found it fit like a glove, addingstructure and a firm core of austere fruit."
633,Leonetti Sangiovese 2014,,"Walla Walla Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,92.0,"Dazzling, dark ruby color. An alluring nose and palate of wet stones, crushed cherries, and ripe strawberries, with lesser notes of sawdust, crème vanilla, elderberries, and roses.

Upon opening the bottle, notes of Luxardo cherries, olallaberries, rose petals, Teuscher truffles and wet stone exude from the glass. The tannins are firm on entry but, the texture broadens and spreads across the palate. 23 months of barrel aging have rounded the wine and given it a juicy, fruit-forward appeal, with nuances of French oak and a lingering finish that will leave you reaching for glass after glass.

Dark, Bordeaux-like aromas of currant and cedar, medium-full body, bright red currant and ripe cherry-like fruit on the palate, notes of cocoa and roasted coffee, very lively on the palate, a touch of oak (but not sweet) and cedar. Nice balance and shows exceptional length. This is not a fruit bomb--it has the real depth and class that many wines at twice the price wish they had. Should pair well with any veal or beef dish, lamb, pork loin or chops, and chicken dishes made with  mushrooms. Pretty good with medium-strong cheeses, too.  "
695,Lewelling Cabernet Sauvignon 2005,,"St. Helena, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,92.0,"A bright bouquet of wild black raspberry, dark plum, and Rainier cherry joined by vanilla, sweet tobacco and new saddle leather.

767,Lewis Cellars Reserve Chardonnay 2017,,"Napa Valley, California",White Wine,93.0,"Think of our 2017 Reserve Chardonnay as a Rolls Royce Wraith – offering a sumptuous interior with serious performance. A plethora of heady aromas alight from the glass with Anjou pear, warm brioche, sweet mineral spice and gardenia blossom. Lush yet lively with great depth and gauzy texture the wine shows impeccable build quality and attention to detail with a miles long finish."
768,Lewis Cellars Reserve Merlot 1995,,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,92.0,"When asked to describe our Reserve Merlot as briefly as possible our response is ""velvet hammer."" Supple and velvety rich on the palate, layered with dark ripe fruit, the wine finishes polished and round."
769,Lewis Cellars Sauvignon Blanc 2016,,"Napa Valley, California",White Wine,90.0,"The warm, vibrant character and seductive imagery of Paul Gauguin's Tahiti are captured in our 2016 Sauvignon Blanc. Awash in ripe mango, guava and papaya and laced with tropical blossoms, vanilla and spice, the wine is lush and luxuriant, fruitful to the core, yet draped in native acidity and a fleck of salinity that frame and lengthen the canvas."
770,Lewis Cellars Sauvignon Blanc 2018,,"Napa Valley, California",White Wine,92.0,"Like a sailplane this 2018 Sauvignon Blanc soars with alluring floral spice, lemon-lime zest and hints of vanilla. A leading edge of native acidity frames a camber line of ripe mango and tropical fruit that tails gracefully with succulent lime skin and subtle mineral."
771,Lewis Cellars Sonoma Chardonnay 2014,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,93.0,"Sourced from 40-year old vines the wine is unusually dense with super ripe blood orange, lime, honeysuckle and Fuji apple spice.

772,Lewis Cellars Sonoma Chardonnay 2015,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,92.0,"Blazing tropical fruit, exotic spices and sexy ripe citrus come together in this tangerine dream. Like a beach volleyball Olympian, the wine has explosive power plus tremendous depth and range on the palate. Richness and precision are continually on point, and the wine sets up high in the mouth before stretching out in a tanned and impossibly long-legged, leesy finish. "
773,Lewis Cellars Sonoma Chardonnay 2017,,"Russian River, Sonoma County, California",White Wine,92.0,"Chardonnay is whole cluster pressed, barrel fermented and aged sur lies with batonnage in 100% French oak for 11-15 months, undergoing 100% malolactic fermentation, then bottled unfined and unfiltered. "
774,Lewis Cellars Sonoma Valley Chardonnay 2008,,"Sonoma County, California",White Wine,91.0,"Our Sonoma Chardonnay comes from some of the oldest Dutton Ranch plantings in Russian River. These vines consistently yield fruit of great complexity and intensity seldom found in other sites. Cooler temperatures toward the end of the 2008 growing season resulted in crisp, well-defined flavors and long ripening times. Ripe citrus, Tupelo honey and sweet floral notes combined with seductive oak and all-spice aromas are just the beginning. Sun-ripened citrus fruit flavors are framed with brilliant acidity giving this wine its trademark zest and tremendous length."
775,Lewis Cellars Syrah Ethan's Blend 2005,,California,Red Wine,92.0,"Now 7 years old, Alec's younger brother Ethan shows sunny pride in his new Ethan's Syrah, Lewis' first bottling since the 2001 vintage. And like the sunflowers and lavender in France this wine displays true Rhone character. From cooler-climate vines this 100% Syrah blend is infused with smoky fruit, white pepper and wild floral notes. Sweet shadings of violet and bacon frame a pure focused palate, gathering weight and richness in a plush and persistent finish."
776,Lewis Cellars Syrah Ethan's Blend 2014,,California,Red Wine,93.0,"Born in 2000, everything about Ethan and his new 2014 Syrah sings ""sweet sixteen."" Vivid color and distinctly ripe, youthful Rhone character shines bright with violets, charcuterie, oak and vanilla spices. Sweet blue fruit and silky tannins with a dash of bacon fat create a round, deliciously fresh palate like steam-polished stones. "
777,Lewis Cellars Syrah Ethan's Blend 2009,,California,Red Wine,94.0,"Positioned between brothers, Alec and Mason, Ethan gets a walk-off home run in his first at-bat since the 2005 vintage. At short-stop Ethan sees lots of action and his wine covers all the bases with black raspberry, yellow peach and pancetta, plus a field of lavender, licorice and violets. Like a seasoned glove the wine has a supple pocket of boysenberry fruit generously laced with sweet oak and vanilla spice. He keeps his eye on the ball and the wine stays focused though a vibrant, youthful finish, making the out on every play."
